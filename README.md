# Siri App Intent Demo

**Session Tracker** is a SwiftUI application that demonstrates how to create and integrate custom App Intents into your app. This project showcases how to extend your app with Siri support, shortcuts, and voice input, while also enabling non-screen feedback for users.  

## The Purpose

Learn how to build and register custom App Intents so Siri and Shortcuts can interact with your app’s entities. This exercise introduces integrating SiriKit with SwiftUI apps and providing meaningful results even without a screen.  

## Features

- Create a custom **App Intent** that acts on a unique entity in your app.  
- Build a custom **shortcut** for your App Intent.  
- Activate the intent using **Siri voice commands**.  
- Provide **spoken responses** from Siri when no screen is available.  
- Support enhanced non-screen Siri interactions with **voice input**.  

## Exercise

Your task is to modify the provided demo app by:  

1. Adding at least one **App Intent** to the app.  
2. Creating a **custom shortcut** for the new intent.  
3. Allowing Siri to **activate the intent via voice commands**.  
4. Enabling Siri to **speak information about the intent’s entity** when no display is available.  
5. Ensuring that the **shortcut accepts voice input**.  
6. Running the app without any crashes or issues.  

## Requirements

- Add a new App Intent to the demo app.  
- The intent must demonstrate acting on a unique entity in your app.  
- Provide a custom shortcut linked to your App Intent.  
- Integrate Siri so it can activate the intent.  
- Support Siri voice output if a screen is not available.  
- Include enhanced non-screen Siri support.  
- Allow the shortcut to handle voice input.  
- Ensure the app runs smoothly without crashes.  

## How to Use

1. **Run the app** in Xcode on a device or simulator.  
2. **Trigger your App Intent** directly in the app or via the Shortcuts app.  
3. **Invoke Siri** and activate your intent with a voice command.  
4. If no display is available, Siri will **speak back the information** about your entity.  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the project in Xcode.  
3. Select a device or simulator and run.  
4. Test the custom shortcut and Siri integration.
